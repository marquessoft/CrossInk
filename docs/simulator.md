# Development Device Simulator

CrossInk can run in the [CrossPoint simulator](https://github.com/uxjulia/crosspoint-simulator), which renders the e-ink display in an SDL2 window. Use it for quick sanity checks without flashing firmware every time.

## Platform Support

The simulator builds on macOS and Linux. `platformio.ini` takes the SDL2 compiler and linker flags from `sdl2-config`, so no hardcoded SDK paths are needed.

- Linux host builds are configured by `scripts/simulator_host_toolchain.py`, which pins the C dialect for GCC 15+ and links OpenSSL for the simulator's MD5 helper.
- Native Windows is not supported. Use WSL and follow the Linux setup.

## Prerequisites

```sh
# macOS
brew install sdl2

# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libssl-dev
```

## Setup

Place EPUB books in `./fs_/books/` relative to the project root. That maps to the SD-card `/books/` path on device.

## Build And Run

```sh
pio run -e simulator
.pio/build/simulator/program
```

Use the X4 Pro environment to enable its touch, frontlight, and Home-key behavior:

```sh
pio run -e x4-pro-simulator -t run_simulator
```

## Keyboard Controls

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Up / Down | Page back / forward (side buttons) |
| Left / Right | Left / right front buttons |
| Return | Confirm / Select |
| Escape | Back |
| P | Power |
| H | X4 Pro Home key (tap to go Home; hold for 700 ms to toggle the reader menu) |

The `H` mapping is active only in `x4-pro-simulator`.

## Cache Note

On first open of an EPUB, an **Indexing...** popup appears while the section cache is built in `.crosspoint/`.

If rendering looks stale after a code change, delete `./fs_/.crosspoint/` to clear simulator caches.
